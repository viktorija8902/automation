# Automation

This project is a result of my experiments with Gulp.

**Tasks in gulpfile.js include:**

* live editing (.scss, .html, .js files)
* code correction with ESlint
* converting ES6 to JS
* JS concatenation and minification
* converting SCSS to compressed CSS
* automatically adding vendor prefixes in CSS and removing unnecessary
* reducing the size of images (.png and .jpg)
* sourcemaps
* running tests

Tasks for production and development are separate.

**All required plugins are in package.json and package-lock.json files.**


*This project (especially gulpfile.js, package.json and package-lock.json files) can be used 
as a template for the future projects. 
It was made while watching "Web tooling & automation" course in Udacity.com.*
